# This is my NLP project where I make a GUI interface. Here you done all things in GUI using buttons.

The dataset which I used is not much good so the prediction is not good, hence you can use your dataset also to get the goood predictions at the end.

You can find the dataset in dataset repository 
Dataset Name :- "train tweet dataset.csv"
